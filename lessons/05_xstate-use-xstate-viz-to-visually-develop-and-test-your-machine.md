[XState Viz](https://xstate.js.org/viz/)

Xstate-viz is an online tool for visualizing state machines.

Looks pretty interesting as a way to visualize and interact with your state machine to test out ideas.

- Saves out as a gist
- Updates based on code
- Looks helpful

## Personal take

So far, I'm not sure how much this adds but I can see it might be easier to spot edge cases and routes through the machine when things are more complex.

I can't seem to find a way to resize the diagrams and the flow arrows seem to be algorithmically placed which means they aren't always in the best place.
