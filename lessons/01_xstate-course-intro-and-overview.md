This course will be split into three parts:

Part 1: Problems the state machines set out to sole
Part 2: Fundamental concepts
Part 3: Advanced state machines

This isn't an exhaustive course but will hopefully be convincing of the utility of state machines and helpful in beginning to implement them in your workflow.

## Personal take

Excited - hoping that I both understand these and can be clear on when they can be helpful in my work and when they are unnecessary.
